If "paranthesis" are not there then the following are the order of operators,

highest --> *,/,%
middle --> +,-
lowest --> =,==,!=,>,<,>=,<=

Also if there is a tie btw the * and / then,

We will see from left to right. as *,/,% follows left to right associativity.

There are some operators that follow right to left associativity as well.
